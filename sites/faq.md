## The Container crashes

- Check if the Container generated a settings.json
    - If it exists, check your settings
    - If it doesn't exist, make sure that you have a folder pointing to /app/settings
- Check if /var/run/docker.sock exists on your machine. Eventually adjust path to docker.sock if it has been relocated

## I updated to a newer image and now it crashes
- I probably added new settings.
    - Back up your settings.json and let the Container generate a new one
        - This will be changed at some point, sorry for the Inconvenience
